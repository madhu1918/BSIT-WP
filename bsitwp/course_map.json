	"overview":["A large part of the Internet users engages with interactive data-driven web applications such as Facebook, Amazon, Gmail, etc. In this course, you will learn the skills required by a full stack developer to create such web applications. A series of tasks will prepare you to iteratively code to produce a \"pixel perfect\" interactive, responsive data-driven web application. There are 3 parts to the course. Front-end, Database and putting it all together as a website.","Front-end of a website is the user experience and the user interfaces that end users engage with. HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript are the enabling technologies for the development of web front-end for applications. Users have several device options to use your website. An important aspect of web front end is the responsive design. Responsive design ensures that your user interfaces adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. A popular front-end web framework called Bootstrap is introduced in the course. Bootstrap simplifies the development of responsive websites. You will learn all of these front-end technologies by doing multiple tasks in the first week of the course.","Dynamic websites are data-driven. Such websites rely on a database to store all the data. The data associated with the web application is typically saved to a database. Data is retrieved when it has to be rendered on the web page. You will learn to write python code to create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) the data from the database. You will also learn to use Object Relational Mapping tools to manipulate data as python objects. The front end and database have to be integrated using python code. Python has some built-in libraries to create an interactive database driven website.","Last week is for learning a lightweight web framework called Flask and for iteratively working on a project.  Web frameworks help developers quickly write code and iteratively complete it. In this week, you will work on a new requirement given by a client. A demo of the client project is given at the end of the course."],
